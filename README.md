Flicker
======

Flicker is a dungeon crawler for Android. It incorporates strategic combat similar to Chess and Hoplite with many Roguelike features for emergent gameplay.

## Development Info ##
See the game's Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/pDYWdLzZ/flicker) for the development roadmap. Once a release candidate is reached I will also be accepting feature requests via this board.
